# Personal-Website
Personal Website is a website that describes my brief bio. There are 3 pages on this website: 
the landing page, an about page and portfolio page. The about page tells about my interests and things I am good at. The portfolio page describes the companies I worked at, technologies I have used in the industry and my personal website project.
